# BigTreeTech HDMI5 Mount for Micron R1 Skirts

This mount I modeled after the R1 Skirts for other displays, but made a mount to fit the HDMI5 based on specs and feedback.  Much thanks to mattd on the doom discord for testing this while my screen was stuck in shipping!

Remaining todo:
- add final flares to corners to match up to R1 z drives
- bottom accent skirts
